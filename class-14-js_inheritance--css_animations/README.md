## Advanced JS topics

We're going to explore some advanced JS topics with *Eloquent JavaScript* and other sources. The goal is not to study them in a manner such that you are going to immediately have command over them, but to give you a basic understanding of what these topics are and find good resources for them.

- Side effects
- Pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference
- Inheritance

## Go over final project assignment

We're going to go over the assignment description for the final project today. Doing so will help you to refine you pitches for today and tomorrow and give you a better idea of what to expect next week.

## Project pitches!

Students who wish to pitch a project can do so. It is not required that all students pitch projects. We'll do a round of pitches today, and another tomorrow, and then narrow it down to **five** projects, each of which will have a 4-person team that is assigned by the instructors and TAs.

We'll keep a list of project pitches in this document
