<!-- # Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 1

- Write a program that accepts user input and, based on that input, displays messages back to the user.


# Technical Requirements

- You may do the work in the same HTML file that we used for our class demo today. Because the originals from class are saved in the class GitHub repo, there is no worry in overwriting them or need for saving an unnecessary extra copy.
- Using a total of four JavaScript `prompt` or `confirm` statements along the lines of our class demo on Monday, have a user answer four questions.
- The user's response to each question (input) should be stored in a separate variable. Name your variables carefully.
- Using these responses, return an alert to the user (output) that concatenates their response into some kind of reply like we did in class.
- Strive to have your alert for each question utilize the responses to all of the prior questions such that by the fourth question, your response would look something like, "Greetings, *Iggy* from *Ipanema*, I also like to eat *bananas* while on vacation in *Paris*."
- Be creative and have fun with your questions/responses! They can be whatever you want so long as the input/output requirements are met.
- In addition, for each response, create a console.log() message that indicates the nature of the question and the user's response, as we did in class.
- In the HTML portion of the file, place the four questions within a series of \<p> tags so that they are listed on the screen.
- If there are any lingering issues with the setup or functionality of your laptop and the software installations, we need to individually address that right away.

# Submitting Your Assignment

- Go to https://gist.github.com
- In the "Gist description..." field, put your name
- In the "Filename including extension..." field put 'index.html'.
- Copy-paste your code into the big input field for the Gist.
- Select the button that says "Create secret gist"; copy that link for submission in the Canvas assignment.
- Add a comment to your Canvas submission with answers to the prompted questions. -->



# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 2

- Your assignment will be to create an "About Me" HTML and JS project that includes a simple resum√© page and a JS-based guessing game about you.

- Note that as we progress through the week, we will be enhancing and extending this project, guided by new user stories that we'll add each day.

### User Stories (MVP)

("MVP" = "Minimum Viable Product" which is the most basic successful functionality of our project. Any extensions, added features, and other enhancements that are optional at a given stage of the project fall under the category of "Stretch Goals.")

This is our first exposure to user stories. This is a device commonly used in software development to identify what the functionality and design of a product should be, by considering the interests and motivations of people with varied and multiple points of view. Our ability to write good user stories, and then realize them in code, is a direct outcome of our ability to show empathy for the needs of all parties who are connected with the project.

User stories typically take the form of, "As X, I want Y, so that Z" but do not necessarily need that exact structure.

- As a student, I want to create an About Me page as a demonstration of my skills with HTML.
- As an eventual jobseeker, I want to get practice in creating a portfolio page so that I can make myself appealing to potential employers.
- As an eventual jobseeker, I would like for potential employers to quickly learn a few things about me, such as a short bio, my education, an overview of my job experience, and my goals.
- As a fun-loving human being, I want to give the visitors to my profile page a guessing game that shows how fun-loving and interesting I am, and maybe include things about myself that would not ordinarily appear in a portfolio page.
- As a developer, I want to use markup to structure my index.html page, so the layout is in the order I prefer, with effective use of the markup possibilities offered by HTML.
- As a developer, I want to carefully design my scripts, so I can understand how to organize and write my code to achieve my goals in interactivity.
- As a developer, I want to create a simple script for my index.html page using JavaScript, so that I can use the browser to send a response to the user.
- As a developer, I want to receive and use the user's name in the opening to the guessing game, so that the program is personalized to their experience.
As a developer, I want to provide five questions to the user, so that they can guess the answers and get to know me.
- As a developer, I want to notify the user after each question whether they were correct (or not!) in their answers.
- As a developer, I want to be able to debug my code by using well structured console messages.
- As a developer, I want to manage my code through an online version control system, so I have the ability to work with others, manage my revisions, and keep a thorough record of my progress.

### Technical Requirements

- A new Github repo will be initialized for this assignment (with a README file written in Markdown), and cloned to your local machine.
- Name this repo about-me and clone it to the root level of your ~/CF/201 directory on your computer.
- Add an index.html file, a style.css file, and an app.js file to your repo, and get them wired together.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax.
- The questions in the guessing game must require yes/no answers, and user input must accept either y/n or yes/no responses, with either .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() used to validate the user input.
- Useful and descriptive console.log messages are well written and correctly displaying to the browser console for each question of the guessing game.
- Add, Commit, Push process is being followed; evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages.

### Supporting Information

#### Git

- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

##### Git Commands:

- `git status`              Provides a detailed description of current state in working directory

- `git add <file>`          Include file in staged/tracked status of working directory

- `git commit -m ''`        Snapshot the tracked changes in current working directory; with message

- `git push`                Push local commits to GitHub

# Add, Commit, Push (ACP): Learn it. Know it. Live it.
