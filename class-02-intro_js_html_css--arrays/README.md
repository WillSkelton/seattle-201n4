# Today's Plan: Class 02 Lecture

- [Go over the assigned readings](#readings)

- Git and GitHub

- [Code demo](#code)

- Announcements:
  - There will be lots of book-based detail work today on JS and CSS. We're going forward with the expectation that you will need little to no instruction on HTML since it is so straightforward.
  - **Be sure to raise questions** about any topics that you'd like to clarify. If it is a topic that we will cover in the future, I'll let you know and maybe give a quick answer for meow. We have a lot to cover today, so it is important to avoid going down time-consuming rabbit-holes.
  - The reasons for going over the JS and CSS chapters in so much detail, even though they do overlap with the pre-work quite a bit:
    1. Not everyone got the same amount of benefit/knowledge from completing pre-work.
    2. There are gaps and omissions, and depth of the subject matter that need to be addressed.
    3. We're focusing on translating into "how we use this" and getting practice in applying this material within our new working environment of Atom, Chrome, and the terminal.

## Readings

- HTML/CSS Chapter 2: "Text"
- HTML/CSS Chapter 10: "Introducing to CSS"
- JS Chapter 2: "Basic JavaScript Instructions"

## Live code

In our code demo today we'll be doing the following:
- Initializing a GitHub repo and working with Git commands
- Reading through the lab assignment, translating it into a to-do list, and fulfilling some technical components such as:
  1. Creating a basic scaffold for a code project
  2. Utilizing `if/else` statements to handle conditional logic
  3. Adding some basic input validation
  4. Utilizing good Git processes including a-c-p cycles
