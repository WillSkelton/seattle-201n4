# Today's Plan: Week 1, Friday Lecture

- Announcements
- Quiz 3 will be published tonight (Friday) and will be due late Sunday night.
- **Reminder:** Quizzes are open-book, so use the resources you choose to figure out the answers: books, internetz, JS console in your browser, whatever. And remember that the quizzes are preparing you for the 301 entrance exam, which you will take on the last weekend of this class (right before Project Week).
- **Reminder:** weekly surveys will go out to students today. Your survey responses are very helpful and meaningful to us. Feedback is a gift.
- Let's take a moment to talk about Memorial Day, because it affects us. It lands on the first day of Project Week. Basically, we can handle that day however we want.
