# Today's Plan: Week 3, Wednesday Lecture

#### Reminder: Quiz 7 will be published after class this morning and will be due at 11:59pm tomorrow night.

#### Quiz 8 will be published tomorrow afternoon, and will be due Friday night at 11:59pm.

#### You will receive a link in an email on Friday to take the entrance exam for Code 301, and it will be due by Monday (not sure if by morning or by end of the day). Please take this exam even if you are not planning to go to Code 301 right away, as it is part of your grade for this course. Also, note that the email you'll receive comes from EDRepublic and, depending on your spam filter settings, might get routed into a spam folder. I'll make an announcement in Slack once I know the link has been sent.

## UI & UX discussion

Let's do a discussion on UI/UX and take a look at some sample student projects from prior classes to evaluate their how they look, how they feel, and how easy they are to use. Let's also look at a few websites relating to design and interaction.
